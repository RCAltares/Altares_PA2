## PA 2.1 NORMALIZATION PROBLEM:
Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation. Mathematically, normalization can be expressed as:
ùëç = ùëã ‚àí ùë•ÃÖ / ùúé

In Python, element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation can be obtained by using .mean() and .std() calls.

In this problem, create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy

```python
 import numpy as np

# make a 5x5 matrix with random numbers
X = np.random.random((5, 5))
print("Original Matrix:\n", X)  

# find the mean and standard deviation of the matrix
mean = X.mean()  
std_dev = X.std() 

# normalize the matrix (subtract mean and divide by standard deviation)
X_normalized = (X - mean) / std_dev
print("\nNormalized Matrix:\n", X_normalized)  

# save the normalized matrix to a file called 'X_normalized.npy'
np.save('X_normalized.npy', X_normalized)

print("\nNormalization complete! The normalized matrix is saved as 'X_normalized.npy'.")


```
        
## PA 2.2 DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM:
Create the following 10 x 10 ndarray. which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers.

From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the result as div_by_3.npy

```python
import numpy as np

# create a list of numbers from 1 to 100
numbers = np.arange(1, 101)

# square each number 
squares = numbers**2

# reshape the list into a 10x10 matrix
A = squares.reshape(10, 10)

# find elements in the matrix that are divisible by 3
div_by_3 = A[A % 3 == 0]

# save the result to a file named 'div_by_3.npy'
np.save('div_by_3.npy', div_by_3)

# print matrices for confirmation 
print("10x10 Matrix of Squares:\n", A)
print("\nElements Divisible by 3:\n", div_by_3)

print("\nDone! The elements divisible by 3 are saved as 'div_by_3.npy'.")
